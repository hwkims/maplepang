# 애니팡 스타일 퍼즐 게임 (Anipang-style Puzzle Game)

This is a browser-based puzzle game inspired by the popular "Anipang" game. The goal is to match three or more identical tiles by clicking on them, causing them to "explode" and increase your score. The game continues until there are no more matches to make.

## Features

- **8x8 Grid**: The game board consists of a grid of 64 tiles, randomly populated with different images.
- **Tile Matching**: Click on tiles to find matching groups of 3 or more adjacent tiles of the same image. The matched tiles explode, and new tiles fall to fill the empty spaces.
- **Score System**: Your score increases with each match you make, with each tile matched giving 10 points.
- **Audio Feedback**: Enjoy sound effects when you make a match or click on an empty tile.
- **Mobile Support**: The game supports touch events for mobile devices.
- **Game Restart**: You can restart the game after it ends.

## Gameplay

1. **Objective**: Find and click on clusters of three or more adjacent tiles with the same image.
2. **Match Mechanism**: Once a match is found, the tiles explode, and the remaining tiles fall to fill the gaps.
3. **Score**: Each match rewards you with points. The more tiles you explode, the higher your score.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends when no more matches are possible.

## How to Play

1. Click (or tap on mobile) tiles to find adjacent tiles of the same type.
2. If you find a match of 3 or more identical tiles, they will explode, and your score will increase.
3. If no further matches can be made, the game will end, and you can choose to restart.

## Getting Started
